	abstract="Dr. Uzgiris has summed up clearly the hierarchical aspect of the organization of the processes of intellectual development as argued by Piaget. She has also underlined the importance of continuous interaction between the organism and the environment, mentioning the complementary role played by the fundamental processes of assimilation and accommodation in this interaction. She has rightly maintained that Piaget is mainly concerned with the development of the intellectual of a normal subject ``in an ideal generalized case.'' The generalization is evidently made from studies carried out under the normal conditions obtaining in modem Western civilization. She has recognized that Piaget regards the role of experience and of sociocultural factors as indispensable in addition to those of maturation. Moreover, Piaget also introduces a general factor of equilibration, which is at work within each of the specific factors and which also regulates their respective influence. It is this equilibratory factor which explains the fact that development necessarily moves toward more extended and stable stages of reasoning. But in fact, though Piaget's theory provides a general theoretical framework for the study of individual differences, these fields of psychology have not given rise to any explicit application of his theory.",

Clinical classifications of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, respectively.The primary distinction between control subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory, while other cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the subjects with MCI were compared with the patients with very mild AD, memory performance was similar, but patients with AD were more impaired in other cognitive domains as well. Longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects with MCI declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with mild AD.Patients who meet the criteria for MCI can be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very mild AD. They appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.Arch Neurol. 1999;56:303-308-->}",

	title = "Virtual and augmented reality enhancements to medical and science student physiology and anatomy test performance: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
	abstract = "Virtual and augmented reality have seen increasing employment for teaching within medical and health sciences programs. For disciplines such as physiology and anatomy, these technologies may disrupt the traditional modes of teaching and content delivery. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality or augmented reality on knowledge acquisition for students studying pre-clinical physiology and anatomy. The protocol was submitted to Prospero and literature search undertaken in PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and other databases. Citations were reviewed and articles published in full assessing learning or knowledge acquisition in pre-clinical physiology and anatomy from virtual or augmented reality were included. Of the 919 records found, 52 eligible articles were reviewed in full-text, with eight studies meeting full eligibility requirements. There was no significant difference in knowledge scores from combining the eight studies (626 participants), with the pooled difference being a non-significant increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI[-2.9;8.6]). For the four studies comparing virtual reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI[-4.1;15.7]). For the five studies comparing augmented reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.07 (95% CI[-7.0;7.2]). Upon review of the literature, it is apparent that educators could benefit from adopting assessment processes that evaluate three-dimensional spatial understanding as a priority in physiology and anatomy. The overall evidence suggests that although test performance is not significantly enhanced with either mode, both virtual and augmented reality are viable alternatives to traditional methods of education in health sciences and medical courses.",
