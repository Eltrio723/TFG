This project has been developed with the aim of proposing and analyzing the use of virtual reality technology as a tool in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment as well as the training of basic cognitive skills such as memory, perception and reasoning. With this aim, human cognition and virtual reality have been studied in order to develop a demo of a serious game able to be used as support for cognitive rehabilitation treatments on people who have seen their cognition deteriorated, or as regular training to keep a healthy one, specially at older ages. The purpose of using virtual reality is to aid in keeping the motivation for the people as well as allowing the possibility to improve the efficacy of current treatments. After the development of this project and later test with people, the system's usability is evaluated, and good results have been obtained. The various cognitive exercises have had good impact and elderly people found no difficulty adapting to virtual reality and playing the game by themselves.
